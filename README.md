# Neovim Configuration

This repository contains my personal Neovim setup, including plugins, themes, and custom settings. 

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) installed on your system. 

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/auri-gabriel/neovim-config.git ~/.config/nvim`

2. Open Neovim and run the following command:

`:PlugInstall`


This will install all plugins listed in the `init.vim` file.

## Customization

Feel free to use this repository as a starting point for your own Neovim setup. You can customize it to fit your needs by modifying the `init.vim` file or by adding your own plugins.
